# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign using supervised machine learning models trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It helps support early diagnosis and awareness through accurate classification.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** Scikit-learn's built-in Breast Cancer dataset
- **Features:** Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- **Target:** Diagnosis (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Checked for missing/null values
- Normalized feature values for consistent scale
- Split dataset into training and test sets (typically 80/20)
